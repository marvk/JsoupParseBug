<description>Red Hat Security Advisory 2012-1255-01 - The libexif packages provide an Exchangeable image file format library. Exif allows metadata to be added to and read from certain types of image files. Multiple flaws were found in the way libexif processed Exif tags. An attacker could create a specially-crafted image file that, when opened in an application linked against libexif, could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. </description>

<description>Red Hat Security Advisory 2012-1256-01 - Ghostscript is a set of software that provides a PostScript interpreter, a set of C procedures and an interpreter for Portable Document Format files. An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in Ghostscript&#39;s International Color Consortium Format library. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript or PDF file with embedded images that would cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Ghostscript. </description>

<description>Ubuntu Security Notice 1548-2 - USN-1548-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new package caused a regression in Private Browsing which could leak sites visited to the browser cache. This update fixes the problem. Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew Sutherland, Jason Smith, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel Holbert discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. Various other issues were also addressed.</description>

<title>RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite Security Update for BEAST Attacks</title>
<link>https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/116406/ESA-2012-032.txt</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/116406/ESA-2012-032.txt</guid>
<comments>https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/116406/RSA-BSAFE-Micro-Edition-Suite-Security-Update-for-BEAST-Attacks.html</comments>
<pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 16:00:16 GMT</pubDate>
<description>RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite contains updates designed to prevent BEAST attacks. There is a known vulnerability in SSLv3 and TLS v1.0 to do with how the Initialization Vector (IV) is generated. For symmetric key algorithms in CBC mode, the IV for the first record is generated using keys and secrets set during the SSL or TLS handshake. All subsequent records are encrypted using the ciphertext block from the previous record as the IV. With symmetric key encryption in CBC mode, plain text encrypted with the same IV and key generates the same cipher text, which is why having a variable IV is important. The BEAST exploit uses this SSLv3 and TLS v1.0 vulnerability by allowing an attacker to observe the last ciphertext block, which is the IV, then replace this with an IV of their choice, inject some of their own plain text data, and when this new IV is used to encrypt the data, the attacker can guess the plain text data one byte at a time.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 15:24:35 GMT</pubDate>
<description>This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in Openfiler version 2.x which could be abused to allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code under the context of the &#39;openfiler&#39; user. The &#39;system.html&#39; file uses user controlled data from the &#39;device&#39; parameter to create a new &#39;NetworkCard&#39; object. The class constructor in &#39;network.inc&#39; calls exec() with the supplied data. The &#39;openfiler&#39; user may &#39;sudo /bin/bash&#39; without providing a system password.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 15:22:32 GMT</pubDate>
<description>This Metasploit module exploits a command execution vulnerability in WAN Emulator version 2.3 which can be abused to allow unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands under the context of the &#39;www-data&#39; user. The &#39;result.php&#39; script calls shell_exec() with user controlled data from the &#39;pc&#39; parameter. This Metasploit module also exploits a command execution vulnerability to gain root privileges. The &#39;dosu&#39; binary is suid &#39;root&#39; and vulnerable to command execution in argument one.</description>

<pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 15:22:06 GMT</pubDate>
<description>This Metasploit module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Winamp 5.55. The flaw exists in the gen_ff.dll and occurs while parsing a specially crafted MAKI file, where memmove is used with in a insecure way with user controlled data. To exploit the vulnerability the attacker must convince the attacker to install the generated mcvcore.maki file in the &quot;scripts&quot; directory of the default &quot;Bento&quot; skin, or generate a new skin using the crafted mcvcore.maki file. The module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1.</description>

<description>Mandriva Linux Security Advisory 2012-150 - Multiple security issues were identified and fixed in OpenJDK (icedtea6). Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 6 and earlier, and 6 Update 34 and earlier, has no impact and remote attack vectors involving AWT and a security-in-depth issue that is not directly exploitable but which can be used to aggravate security vulnerabilities that can be directly exploited. Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 6 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Beans, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-3136. The updated packages provides icedtea6-1.11.4 which is not vulnerable to these issues.</description>

<description>Ubuntu Security Notice 1527-2 - USN-1527-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Expat. This update provides the corresponding updates for XML-RPC for C and C++. Both issues described in the original advisory affected XML-RPC for C and C++ in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04 LTS. It was discovered that Expat computed hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU resources. Tim Boddy discovered that Expat did not properly handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory resources. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS, 11.04 and 11.10. Various other issues were also addressed.</description>

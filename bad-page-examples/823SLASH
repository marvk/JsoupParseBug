<description>Ubuntu Security Notice 2085-1 - It was discovered that the HPLIP Polkit daemon incorrectly handled temporary files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite arbitrary files. In the default installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and higher, this should be prevented by the Yama link restrictions. It was discovered that HPLIP contained an upgrade tool that would download code in an unsafe fashion. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. Various other issues were also addressed.</description>

<description>Red Hat Security Advisory 2014-0045-01 - Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks into a single solution for Java applications. The JBoss Seam Remoting component provides a convenient method of remotely accessing Seam components from a web page, using AJAX. It was found that the ExecutionHandler, PollHandler, and SubscriptionHandler classes in JBoss Seam Remoting unmarshalled user-supplied XML and resolved external entities in this XML. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XML External Entity attacks. </description>

<description>Red Hat Security Advisory 2014-0044-01 - Augeas is a utility for editing configuration. Augeas parses configuration files in their native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native configuration files. Augeas also uses &quot;lenses&quot; as basic building blocks for establishing the mapping from files into the Augeas tree and back. A flaw was found in the way Augeas handled certain umask settings when creating new configuration files. This flaw could result in configuration files being created as world writable, allowing unprivileged local users to modify their content. </description>

<description>Red Hat Security Advisory 2014-0043-01 - The Berkeley Internet Name Domain is an implementation of the Domain Name System protocols. BIND includes a DNS server ; a resolver library ; and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly. A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled queries for NSEC3-signed zones. A remote attacker could use this flaw against an authoritative name server that served NCES3-signed zones by sending a specially crafted query, which, when processed, would cause named to crash. </description>

<description>Mandriva Linux Security Advisory 2014-011 - Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in java-1.7.0-openjdk. An input validation flaw was discovered in the font layout engine in the 2D component. A specially crafted font file could trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption when processed. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the CORBA, JNDI, and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Serviceability, Security, CORBA, JAAS, JAXP, and Networking components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. It was discovered that the Beans component did not restrict processing of XML external entities. This flaw could cause a Java application using Beans to leak sensitive information, or affect application availability. It was discovered that the JSSE component could leak timing information during the TLS/SSL handshake. This could possibly lead to disclosure of information about the used encryption keys. The updated packages provides a solution for these security issues.</description>

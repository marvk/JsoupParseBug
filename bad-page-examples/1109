<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-166 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP LeftHand Virtual SAN Appliance. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The flaw exists within the hydra component which listens by default on 13841/tcp. The hydra daemon is responsible for management remote operations such as user creation, snapshots, etc. Insufficient authentication is performed prior to performing administrative level tasks. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-165 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Operations Agent for NonStop Server. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must check the status of an existing node on the network. The specific flaw exists within ELinkService process which listens on TCP ports 7771 and 8976 by default. The process performs insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data within in a HEALTH packet prior to copying it into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed message packets to the target, which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-164 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Intelligent Management Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the img.exe component, which listens by default on TCP port 8800. When handling message packets, the process performs arithmetic on an unvalidated user-supplied values used to determine the size of a new heap buffer, allowing a potential integer wrap to cause a heap buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the user.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-161 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the EMC Autostart ftAgent, which is deployed on machines managed by EMC Autostart by default. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing routines for op-codes used by EMC Autostart ftAgent&#39;s proprietary network protocol. This ftAgent.exe service listens on TCP port 8045, and performs arithmetic for memory size calculation using values read from the network without validation. This arithmetic is susceptible to integer overflow, causing the memory allocation to be undersized, ultimately allowing for heap-based memory corruption. An attacker can exploit this condition to gain remote code execution as user SYSTEM.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-157 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of Series records. The code within Excel.exe makes an assumption about the data types within a Series record and can be made to write beyond the bounds of a heap buffer when a specific combination of fields are set to unexpected values. This corruption can be leveraged to achieve code execution under the context of the user running the application.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-156 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists due to insufficient signature checks with the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client. When the client is invoked through the ActiveX control it downloads and checks a file called vpndownloader.exe. This file has to be properly signed by Cisco. Once this file is downloaded it is run and downloads additional configuration files. Within the downloaded config file it is possible to force a download of executable files. Those files are not properly checked for valid certificates and are run on the host as soon as they are downloaded.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-154 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Notes. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within notes.exe. When handling URLs, it is possible to inject the -RPARAMS command line argument into the call to notes.exe, which will then launch rcplauncher.exe. Including the java -vm command will allow for the attacker to execute code under the context of the process.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-153 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within Quicktime.qts when parsing the &#39;sean&#39; atom. The size specified in the atom&#39;s header is added to 0x0C and subsequently allocated. File data is then copied into that buffer along with a series of nulls. If the buffer is undersized, the copy operation can be made to corrupt adjacent memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the process.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-152 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of applications that utilize Oracle&#39;s Outside In Technology. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of Excel files. When handling the MergeCells record, the process does not properly validate size values which can lead to an integer overflow. The resulting value is used to allocate a heap buffer which can be corrupted by an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the application.</description>

<description>Zero Day Initiative Advisory 12-151 - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of products utilizing Oracle&#39;s Outside In Technology. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the library&#39;s parsing of Excel files. When handling the TxO record, the vseshr.dll module can be made to wrap an integer value when parsing a specific field. This can lead to an improper memory allocation that can be leveraged to corrupt the heap leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the application.</description>
